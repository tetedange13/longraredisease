## Introduction

**nf-core/longraredisease** is a specialized bioinformatics pipeline for **structural variant (SV) detection and clinical interpretation** from long-read sequencing data (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio). Designed for rare disease diagnostics, it delivers high-confidence variant discovery through multi-caller consensus, family-based analysis, and phenotype-driven prioritization.

![Long-read sequencing pipeline](docs/images/longraredisease_pipeline.png)

The pipeline supports:

- **Multi-caller SV consensus** — Sniffles, CuteSV, SVIM with JASMINE merging
- **Phase-aware calling** — Haplotype-resolved SV detection using LongPhase
- **Family analysis** — Trio-based joint calling and de novo variant detection
- **Clinical annotation** — AnnotSV with disease database integration
- **Phenotype prioritization** — SVANNA-based ranking using HPO terms
- **Optional analyses** — SNVs (Clair3/DeepVariant), CNVs (Spectre/HiFiCNV), STRs (Straglr), Methylation (Modkit)

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,file_path,hpo_terms,sex,phenotype,family_id,maternal_id,paternal_id
sample1,/path/to/sample1.bam,HP:0002721;HP:0002110,1,2,,,
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/longraredisease \
    -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
    --input samplesheet.csv \
    --outdir <OUTDIR> \
    --fasta reference.fasta \
    --sequencing_platform ont
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided with the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details on pipeline usage and parameters, see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/longraredisease/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to [docs/output.md](docs/output.md).

## Credits
